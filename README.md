# Determination of Hall of Fame Status for Major League Baseball Players



The selection of baseball player’s for Major League Baseball’s Hall of Fame (HoF) have always been considered a hot topic of discussion amongst fans, players, media etc. Each year the BBWAA members form a committee and come to a unanimous decision of selecting certain baseball player’s to be honored a position in the Hall of Fame. The purpose of this study is to conduct a statistical analysis on collected data to determine whether or not a player would be elected into the Hall of Fame. The data consisted of two datasets baseballHOF and baseballHOF2019 with a sample size of 602 baseball players and 8 baseball players respectively. The data consisted of information on the number of seasons a player played in (Yrs), games played during career(G), runs scored during players career (R) , batting average (BA) etc. A multivariate statistical technique called linear discriminant analysis was performed in the study. The results predict that Todd Helton and Miguel Tejada will be chosen for the hall of fame as these players’ have a discriminant function value larger than the cut off point -0.89757673. In conclusion, out of the 8 baseball players only 2 baseball players were predicted to be considered eligible for the Hall of Fame of 2019.
